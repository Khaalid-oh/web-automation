        <p>
            WebAutomation was born from a desire of a group of technologists to democratise the use of data to grow businesses. Coming from corporate backgrounds and seeing how big businesses use data automation to gain competitive advantages and win, we knew that every business deserved an opportunity and access to data intelligence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We started helping businesses by writing, hosting and maintaining custom web scrapers, but our customers demanded a solution that could put them back in control and alleviate them from the pain of maintaining custom scrapers. We saw an opportunity to create an ultimate easy-to-use tool to scrape web data.

            WebAutomation was born!
